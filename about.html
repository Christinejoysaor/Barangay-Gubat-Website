                <h2>History</h2>
                <p>Gubat was originally a big barrio of Bulusan,
                    inhabited by a few Tagalogs, Visayans and Albayanons who travelled on foot to hunt wild animals. 
                    These people built their homes close to the shore and called their location Buri,
                    which today is the barrio of Buenavista.</p>
